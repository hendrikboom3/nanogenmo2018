# nanogenmo2018

I'm trying to produce a calculus for generating story plots.
So far I've implement the rudiments of a deduction system.
I plan on implementing a reasonong system about motivations, emotions, and the like.
No, I don't think it'll be adequate for a proper understanding of psychology.
This approach has no hope in hell of accomplishing that.
But it might provide a framework for generating hackneyed plot outlines.

If it accomplishes this during this year's nanogenmo I'll be surprised.
